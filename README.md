# Physical properties of Agricultural materials

The information on physical properties of agricultural materials has proven to be vital in the design of equipment that will be used in carrying out operations related to those materials.

However, a single and readily-available source of these information on various products has always been missing.

Addressing this problem will have practical benefits for students and learners of the topic, for Engineers, Technicians, Agriculturists and other individuals who, from time to time need this information to carry out activities related to agricultural materials.

The purpose of this work, therefore, is to find and holistically gather the properties of as many Agricultural materials as possible that have been determined by other studies and organize them into a simple, yet robust web application with a user friendly Interface and a nice user experience.
